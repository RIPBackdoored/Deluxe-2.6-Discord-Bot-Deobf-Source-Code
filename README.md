# Deluxe 2.6 Discord Bot Deobf Source Code
## SourceFile attributes are always a cherry on top

I deobfuscated this thing from complete unlegibility to pretty much the source code as it originally was
even was able to restore class, field, and method names

idk what this obfuscation is but its trash, not as trash as para but trash nonetheless.

Enjoy skidding? i guess??
whatever
